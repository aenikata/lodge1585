The Lodge is active in three ways.

## Gibb & Whitbread Memorial Benevolent Fund
Bro Gibb died in 1960 and left a legacy of £10,000 to the Lodge.  The brethren decided that the best way to use this money was to establish a charitable trust.  This trust was created by a declaration entitled “The Royal Commemoration Lodge No 1585 Gibb Memorial Benevolent Fund” on 14th February 1962.  Bro Whitbread died in 1975 and left a legacy of £2000 which was incorporated into the Gibb Fund.  The original trust deed was very restrictive, for example new trustees could only be appointed by a formal alteration of the deed, which because of the cost meant that by 2004 only one legally appointed trustee was in post.  So, the Lodge resolved to make this and other changes by a resolution on 8th December 2004, including changing the name to the Gibb & Whitbread Memorial Benevolent Fund.  These initial bequests have provided regular funding for Lodge widows and specified charities for 60 years and, due to careful management exceed £40000.  As a result, the trustees have resolved to support projects at each of the 18 RMBI Homes and 8 grants have been made so far.


## Relief Chest
Traditionally the Charity Steward asked each member at the Festive Board for a cash donation, which was duly recorded on a small card that each individual brought to the meeting.  The sums collected were deposited in a separate account known as the Charities Association.  Members unable to attend sent a cheque, a practice that continues to this day.

On 1st January 1986 the Grand Charity (now the Masonic Charitable Foundation) introduced the Relief Chest Scheme which replaced the Lodge’s Charities Association, because it provided a central account thus removing the need for the Lodge to maintain its own separate account.  More importantly it provided the following advantages: -
1. Donations could be collected by standing order (now direct debit) instead of cash
2. The sums could be debited monthly, quarterly or annually thus spreading the burden and avoiding missed contributions due to absence
3. Donations could be made under covenant (now gift aid) thus attracting tax relief at 25% 
4. Accumulating balances earn interest at favourable rates due to the size of the funds being managed.

The Lodge adopted the Relief Chest Scheme in 1989.  In recent years donations amounting to £18350 have been made.  These donations are approved by resolution at the Installation Meeting and conventionally are made to charities nominated by the Worshipful Master.
More recently the Relief Chest introduced Gift Aid envelopes enabling members and visitors to make donations in place of the traditional charity collection at each meeting. include amounts from visitors, thereby attracting tax relief and interest.
The main task of the Charity Steward is to ask the members to authorise their direct debits and arrange the charity collections at each meeting.


## Lodge General Fund
Donations to charity from Lodge Funds have been restricted in the past but the Lodge has resolved to use surplus funds to support the work of the Gibb & Whitbread in the event that further monies are needed to complete its programme.
