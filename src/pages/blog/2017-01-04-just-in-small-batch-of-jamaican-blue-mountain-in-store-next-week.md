As can be confirmed in Lane's Masonic Records, Royal Commemoration Lodge 1585 received its warrant of constitution in 1875. In 2025 it will therefore celebrate 150 years as a lodge, so brethren are part of something with a rich and long history.

Its original meeting place was the Star and Garter Hotel in Putney, and it has always been a London-based lodge.

More recently it holds its lodge meetings at Freemasons' Hall in Holborn, with dining afterwards varying in location, most recently at the Grand Connaught Rooms right by Freemasons' Hall.
