The Lodge meets four times a year on the fourth Wednesdays in February and October, the second Wednesday in May and the second Monday in December.  Meetings are held at Freemasons Hall, 60 Great Queen Street, London WC2B 5AZ.  As often as possible meetings start at 5 pm and finish at 7 pm.  

Each meeting is followed by a Festive Board (Formal Dinner) commencing at 7.30 pm, thus giving members and their guests time for liquid refreshment, and finish no later than 9.30 pm.  Dining venues may vary but our current home is Browns at 82-84 St Martin’s Lane.  

This is an impressive venue housed in the former Westminster County Court on St Martin’s Lane, it has high ceilings, statement chandeliers and period features which characterise its comfortable interior, with four ‘Courtrooms’ available for our Festive board.

Traditionally the Lodge has arranged three other events each year.  Every November there is a Lodge Supper which is an informal dinner when members can bring their guests and prospective members can be welcomed and given taste of our fellowship. 
Normally, in the summer there is a Ladies Luncheon, comprising a visit to a place of interests and followed by lunch in a convivial hostelry, when members are encouraged to bring their ladies.  Spring typically characterised a Ladies Evening.  In the past these were large and spectacular events in splendid venues.  These days they are more restrained affairs, but hugely enjoyed when they happen.
